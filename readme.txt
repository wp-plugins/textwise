== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is Similarity Search? =

Similarity Search analyzes a body of text in order to find the concepts within it. The responses we provide from our database are the results that closely match those same concepts.

At the core of this process are Semantic Signatures&reg;, a new way of representing and analyzing semantic information in text. Semantic Signatures provide a representation of the multiple concepts and topics contained in a body of text, whether a few words or an entire document.

= How does the plugin work? =

By using the freely available SemanticHacker API to access our Semantic Search technology, the content of a blog post is analyzed and matched with related content. Those suggestions are displayed as you edit your post.

= How can I use images and video into my post? =

Click-on or drag-and-drop the image thumbnail to add it to your post. Click a video suggestion to insert it. Remove the image or video from the post by clicking the selection again.

Image settings and formatting can be changed by using the image controls built in to WordPress. Select the image and then click the ***Edit Image*** icon.

Video settings can be changed through the Wordpress embedded media settings. Select the placeholder for the video and then click the ***Insert / edit embedded media*** button on the second row of buttons in the editor. *If the second row is not visible, show the "Kitchen Sink" by clicking the last button on the first row of the editor.*

= How can I move an image or video once it is in my post? =

To move the image and it's caption, be sure to highlight both the image and caption with your mouse. Then cut &amp; paste.

= How can I include Relevant Content Suggestions in my post? =

Click to select related content. Your highlighted sections will be shown in the published post.

= Will changes made with the plugin remain if I decide to uninstall it? =

Videos, images, and content links added to the body of your posts will remain unless you remove them. Selected Tags and Categories will remain as well.  Related news, articles, and product listings will no longer be displayed.

= Can I hide some suggestions if I don't want to use them? =

You may change these options in the Settings section. Please note that videos, images, content links in the body of your post as well as tags and categories that were selected on existing posts will remain. When you hide related news, articles, or product suggestions, those areas will be hidden on all posts across the blog.

= How will the results appear on my customized theme? =

Elements added to the blog by the TextWise plugin have been designed to conform to your selected theme as seamlessly as possible. To select the logo that best fits with your theme, please see the Settings screen for variations. Your mileage may vary.
