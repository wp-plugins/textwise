== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is Similarity Search? =

Similarity Search analyzes a body of text in order to find the concepts within it. The responses we provide from our database are the results that closely match those same concepts.

At the core of this process are Semantic Signatures&reg;, a new way of representing and analyzing semantic information in text. Semantic Signatures provide a representation of the multiple concepts and topics contained in a body of text, whether a few words or an entire document.

= How does the plugin work? =

By using the freely available SemanticHacker API to access our Semantic Search technology, the content of a blog post is analyzed and matched with related content. Those suggestions are displayed as you edit your post.
